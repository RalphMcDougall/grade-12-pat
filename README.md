My year project for IT in grade 12. It is a top-down 2D roguelike game. It was created in 4 parts over a 6 month span from March 2018 until August 2018. All extra planning and technical documents that were created for the project are included in the repository. It implements map randomisation and enemy path-finding. The project specification required a database to be used with MS Access which is why that was used.

## Usage Guide
Open the RalphMcDougallPAT2018 project in NetBeans on Windows for optimal usage. Run the project from the IDE (not the JAR). The login/character selectoin screen should open.

Once the character has been selected, the game's main menu should open.

![Main menu](readme_images/main_view.PNG?raw=true "Main menu")

From here, the game can be started.

## Required software
* NetBeans
* Windows 10

## Issues
It currently only works for Windows since the database driver is specific to MS Access. This can be done a lot better, but it was required for the school project.
